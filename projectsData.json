From the registration to the running of the event we showcased our skills in systems integration and audio-visual design using top-notch technology.\n\n Using a registration and database solution designed by us, attendees were signed in seamlessly on 5 iPads designated for the purpose. The main event; the live demonstration of the Forbes8 app happened on a Forbes8 branded, raised platform stage, fitted with presentation support and our unique screen podium.Anchored on an industrial grade, black powder finish, steel frame, the podium sported a 37” portrait banner display, a bluetooth presentation remote, an in-built dual gooseneck microphone and an adjustable glass top that made for a very comfortable presentation and unveiling of the app.\n\n The unveil itself was a sensory party executed through a lighting design combining lighting, motion graphics and sound effects. The high quality sound that contributed to the amazing experience came from a pair of 3ft totem linear array tops with 14” subs. On a 36 square meter screen made up of 1000 x 500 square meter P3 block cabinet screens, and with the aid of moving heads, effect lighting was synchronised to the soundtrack and showcase video providing the viewer with the best experience of an initial introduction to the Forbes8 app.",

The team always displayed a ‘can do it’ spirit. The communication on the projects are global standard, with constant assurance of success to the client. \n\n I knew what the end picture was, in terms of what I wanted to achieve with the project. All I did was brief the team on the 'what', and they dealt with the 'how' with ease. The team was professional always, they also went beyond their prescribed work and lent their services to other aspects of the project that would make it flawless and memorable. \n\n Strong work ethic, professionalism, creativity & innovation, a collaborative approach and dedicated support characterise this team. I will recommend iamadinkra without reservation."

The team worked with us mostly on Live broadcast and video conferencing projects. They came highly recommended by the industry. \n\n My initial impression was that they are a very professional and innovative team, and have excelled at this continually. My most pleasant experience working with the team was during the planning and setup of equipment for the newly built independence Avenue building. From start to finish they kept my team informed and updated while simultaneously providing insight into the best and recommended practices to use for a successful audio visual design and integration project. \n\n They are simply the best there is! Their project planning & communication; Service delivery quality and timelines as well as technical support is excellent. With pride, thoughtfulness and attention to detail, you are the audio visual’s best for me. You have my unreserved recommendation any day."
